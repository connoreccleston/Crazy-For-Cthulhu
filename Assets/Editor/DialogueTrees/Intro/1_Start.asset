  Dialogue: "A storm looms overhead, above a calm sea. It\u2019s quiet, as if no living
    thing dares to invade this space. \r\nAlong the shoreline is an endless line of
    people in black hoods kneeling.\r\nYou nudge a space between two people. They
    don\u2019t notice you. They just keep staring out into the sea.\r\nA cultist steps
    forward and begins chanting. \r"
