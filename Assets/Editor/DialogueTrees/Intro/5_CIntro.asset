  Dialogue: "The figure gestures to the shoreline, causing massive tidal waves.\nThey
    engulf you, pulling you into the dark blue waters.\r\nYou sink, even as your limbs
    flail and fight against the current. Water fills your vision, your mouth, your
    lungs.  \r\nThere\u2019s no strength left. Before your eyes close, the figure
    approaches you. "
