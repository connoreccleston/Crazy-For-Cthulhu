  Dialogue: "You awake from your unpleasant food stupor.\r\nYou\u2019re in an outfit
    that is dated\u2026like 1920s formal.\r\nIt\u2019s a little dusty, but still looks
    pretty nice.\r\nYou roll off of the sacrificial altar.\r\nEvery movement fills
    you with a profound nausea.\r\nCthulhu approaches you, wearing a top hat and a
    ridiculously large bowtie."
